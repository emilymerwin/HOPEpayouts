HOPEpayouts
===========
hopepayouts.html is the version we are using on the live site. hopepayouts_stacked.html uses flot.js's stacking plugin to create stacked area charts - I like this approach with this data set but it would have needed more instructions and probably a toggle between it and the line chart view and I didn't have time to do that.

Wanted to do this with d3 but had trouble accessing nested objects in the json - probably just need to structure the json differently rather than figure out the nesting. There are a bunch of parsers and their results in the data folder, but all of the data actually being used by the interactive is in the .html file. 

This ran 9/8/13 along with this story: http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/at-20-hope-enters-era-of-uncertainty/nZngx/
